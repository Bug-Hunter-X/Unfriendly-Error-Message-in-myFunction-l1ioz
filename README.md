# Unfriendly Error Message in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common MATLAB error: an unhelpful error message when an invalid input is given to a function.  The original code throws a generic error, while the solution provides a more informative and user-friendly error message.

## Bug
The `myFunction` function lacks robust error handling. When a negative number is passed as input, it throws a basic error message, making it hard to diagnose the issue.

## Solution
The improved version includes a more descriptive error message, making it easier for users to understand the problem and fix their code.
